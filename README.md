Notebooks for generating reliability diagram figures


Figure 1: RPC and idealised model regression coefficient contour plots

Figure 1 is generated using 3 notebooks as described in the corresponding README.md in the Figure_1 directory.


Figure 2: 4 panel plot of reliability diagrams for ECMWF and DePreSys data over the period 1980-2010

The DePreSys coordinate data is generated by running notebook 'df3_NAO_reliability_diagrams_1980-2010.ipynb'
The df3.txt NAO data is made up of 40 ensembles and ranges from 1980-2010.

The ECMWF data is generated by running notebook 'NAO_reliability_diagrams_ECMWF.ipynb' and selecting the range 1980-2010 rather than the full 1902-2010 range of the data (running the 6th cell instead of the 5th)

Once the coordinate and uncertainty data has been generated running notebook 'Figure_2_reliability_plots_1980-2010.ipynb'.


Figure 3: reliability diagrams for ECMWF over full period 1901-2010

Figure 3 is generated by running notebook 'NAO_reliability_diagrams_ECMWF.ipynb' and selecting the full 1902-2010 range of the data.
